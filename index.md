## About Me
I am a first-year PhD student at Dartmouth College, advised by Prof. [Bo Zhu](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~bozhu/). I love everything about fluid simulation algorithms, and focus my research on this field.     

Before coming to Dartmouth, I received my Bachelor degree at Peking University in 2020, advised by Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/baoquan/).
